# The Boxscore Challenge
The Boxscore is the goto widget on any sports site to get quick information about a game.  ESPN, Fox Sports, theScore, and many others have solutions.

Here is ESPNâ€™s solution. They even went ahead and added pitchers info.

The Boxscore challenge gives you the opportunity to use newer concepts and forces you to use best practices when it comes to its design and engineering.

### We want you to do the following:
* Build an API using NodeJS to consume the Feed below.
	* Feed 1: http://
	* Feed 2: http://
	* Store the info in a database. (Mongo???)
* Build a small React project.  
	* The HTML & CSS is provided for you in this repo.

### Things to Consider
* The various states that the box score widget would be in during the lifespan of the game. (ie. pre-game, in-game, and post-game)
* The types of data displayed and how data is organized for different types of sports. (ie. football has 4 quarters and displays the total score, while baseball has 9 innings, sometimes more, and displays not only the total score, but hits and errors.)
* The assets, elements, and concepts shared between the box scores for any number of different types of sports. (ie. all sports have two teams playing against one another.  The away is on top, and the home team is on the bottom.  There is always a spot that communicates the progress of the game (Top 3rd, 1st Qtr, 3rd Period, Final).

* In order to maintain a streamlined, maintainable, and easily testable codebase, we should strive to build components that are highly adaptable. We don't want to build a box score component for every type of sport we are covering, but instead, create a component that can be used any time we want to display a box score for a game.

### Deliverable
* Send us two repos.
	* A baseball game, Top of the12th inning
	* A football game, Final
	* A hockey game, 1st Period

*Extra Credit*: Use javascript to populate the boxscores using JSON.
